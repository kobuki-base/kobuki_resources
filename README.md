# Kobuki Resources

Drawings, models, specifications and media resources for Kobuki.

## Notes

The original resources have moved around frequently but are (currently) still
available at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B32hZvk-n37zZjlLcHpwcWVFUEE. 
In order to preserve a constant link for documentation purposes as well as ensuring
a backup exists, a selected subset of those resources have been made available here.

These resources are linked to from other websites and documentation sources. 
Please endeavour to keep the folder/file structure as constant as possible.
